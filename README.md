# Untitled Space Game

Player starts in a planetary system.

Weapons shoot automatically. Player just flies.

Enemies swarm the player. When destroyed, enemies drop warp fuel.

When the player has enough warp fuel, they can fly to the edge of the screen to warp to the next planetary system.

Planetary systems buy (and sell?) commodities, and you must trade for maximum profit.

Upon arriving at the next planetary system, a player can purchase upgrades with currency earned by trading.

Chevron is displayed around edges of screen to indicate position of planet.

Some sort of loot is placed randomly throughout the level to encourage exploration.

After warping into a planetary system, your scanners will start working.

They will reveal the commodities in the sector one by one. When all commodities are collected, your scanners will search for the other planetary systems that can be warped to.

When the player dies they can spend (some sort of points that they earned somehow) for permanent unlocks and/or boosts.
