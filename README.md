# Untitled Space Game

Player starts in a planetary system.

Weapons shoot automatically. Player just flies.

Enemies swarm the player. When destroyed, enemies drop warp fuel.

When the player has obtained enough warp fuel, they can fly to the edge of the screen to warp to the next planetary system.

Upon arriving at the next planetary system, a player can purchase upgrades.

Possibly, planetary systems buy and sell commodities, and you must trade for maximum profit.

Chevron is displayed around edges of screen to indicate position of planet. (or, minimap)

Some sort of loot is placed randomly throughout the level to encourage exploration.
